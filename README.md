# C- Compiler
## A C- compiler made for a unicycle computer system based on MIPS with RISC instruction set utilizing FLEX and YACC-Bison

This repository consists of a C- Compiler, a subset of the C language, made for a unicyclic computer system based on MIPS with RISC instruction set [(1)](https://github.com/TalesNogueira/Unicycle-MIPS-Based-Computer-System) using FLEX (Fast Lexical Analyzer Generator) for the lexical analyzer and YACC-Bison for the syntactic analyzer.
